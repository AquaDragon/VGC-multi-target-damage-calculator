# Pokémon VGC Multi-Target Damage Calculator

This is a tool currently in development for performing quick damage calculations against multiple targets. It is intended to help with teambuilding, matchup planning and exploring various battle scenarios.

The current inputs are two teams formatted in PokePastes or Pokémon Showdown!-styled text. The GUI will then generate a cross-table showing all relevant damage calculations between the two teams.

Planned features in development / to-do list:

- Reorganize layout & presentation
- Interface to allow editing of team information
- Statistics
- Allow calculations vs. more than 6 Pokémon

Optimized for VGC formats in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet.
